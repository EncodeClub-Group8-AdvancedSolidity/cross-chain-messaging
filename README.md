```

## ðŸš€ Getting Started with Greeter

### Supersim Vanilla

```shell
$ supersim --interop.autorelay
```
Supersim creates three anvil blockchains:

1. L1 at http://127.0.0.1:8545
2. OPChainA	at http://127.0.0.1:9545
3. OPChainB	at http://127.0.0.1:9546

### Store the configuration in environment variables
In a separate shell,
```shell
USER_ADDR=0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
PRIV_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
RPC_L1=http://localhost:8545
RPC_A=http://localhost:9545
RPC_B=http://localhost:9546
```

### Deploy Greeter

```shell
$ GREETER_B_ADDR=`forge create --rpc-url $RPC_B --private-key $PRIV_KEY Greeter --broadcast | awk '/Deployed to:/ {print $3}'`
```

### Deploy GreetingSender to chain A

```shell
$ GREETER_A_ADDR=`forge create --rpc-url $RPC_A --private-key $PRIV_KEY --broadcast GreetingSender --constructor-args $GREETER_B_ADDR 902 | awk '/Deployed to:/ {print $3}'`
```

### Send a message
Send a greeting from chain A to chain B.
```shell
$ cast call --rpc-url $RPC_B $GREETER_B_ADDR "greet()" | cast --to-ascii 
cast send --private-key $PRIV_KEY --rpc-url $RPC_A $GREETER_A_ADDR "setGreeting(string)" "Hello from chain A, with a CrossDomainSetGreeting event"
sleep 2
cast call --rpc-url $RPC_B $GREETER_B_ADDR "greet()" | cast --to-ascii
```

### Read the log entries

```shell
$ cast logs --rpc-url $RPC_B 'CrossDomainSetGreeting(address,uint256,string)'
echo $GREETER_A_ADDR
echo 0x385 | cast --to-dec
```


## ðŸš€ Getting Started with SuperchainERC20


### 1. Initialize .env files:

```sh
npm run init:env
```
### 2. Install project dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```
### 3. Start the development environment:

This command will:

- Start the `supersim` local development environment
- Deploy the smart contracts to the test networks
- Launch the example frontend application

```sh
npm run dev
```

## ðŸ“¦ Deploying SuperchainERC20s

### Configuring RPC urls

This repository includes a script to automatically fetch the public RPC URLs for each chain listed in the [Superchain Registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/chainList.json) and add them to the `[rpc_endpoints]` configuration section of `foundry.toml`.

The script ensures that only new RPC URLs are appended, preserving any URLs already present in `foundry.toml`. To execute this script, run:

```sh
npm run update:rpcs
```

### Deployment config

The deployment configuration for token deployments is managed through the `deploy-config.toml` file. Below is a detailed breakdown of each configuration section:

#### `[deploy-config]`

This section defines parameters for deploying token contracts.

- `salt`: A unique identifier used for deploying token contracts via [`Create2`]. This value along with the contract bytecode ensures that contract deployments are deterministic.
  - example: `salt = "ethers phoenix"`
- `chains`: Lists the chains where the token will be deployed. Each chain must correspond to an entry in the `[rpc_endpoints]` section of `foundry.toml`.
  - example: `chains = ["op_chain_a","op_chain_b"]`

#### `[token]`

Deployment configuration for the token that will be deployed.

- `owner_address`: the address designated as the owner of the token.
  - The `L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol` contract included in this repo extends the [`Ownable`](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/c3b2ffb4a3334ea519555c5ea11fb0e666f8c2bc/src/auth/Ownable.sol) contract
  - example: `owner_address = "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"`
- `name`: the token's name.
  - example: `name = "TestSuperchainERC20"`
- `symbol`: the token's symbol.
  - example: `symbol = "TSU"`
- `decimals`: the number of decimal places the token supports.
  - example: `decimals = 18`

### Deploying a token

Before proceeding with this section, ensure that your `deploy-config.toml` file is fully configured (see the [Deployment config](#deployment-config) section for more details on setup). Additionally, confirm that the `[rpc_endpoints]` section in `foundry.toml` is properly set up by following the instructions in [Configuring RPC urls](#configuring-rpc-urls).

Deployments are executed through the `SuperchainERC20Deployer.s.sol` script. This script deploys tokens across each specified chain in the deployment configuration using `Create2`, ensuring deterministic contract addresses for each deployment. The script targets the `L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol` contract by default. If you need to modify the token being deployed, either update this file directly or point the script to a custom token contract of your choice.

To execute a token deployment run:

```sh
npm run deploy:token

```


# Cross-Chain Vault System

This project implements a cross-chain vault system that allows users to deposit tokens on one chain and have them available on another chain through Optimism's cross-chain messaging infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- Foundry installed
- Access to two Optimism chains (Chain A and Chain B)
- Private key with sufficient funds on both chains
- Environment variables set up

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cross-chain-messaging
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
forge install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Your private key (same on both chains)
export PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# RPC endpoints for both chains
export RPC_A="http://127.0.0.1:9545"  # Chain A RPC endpoint
export RPC_B="http://127.0.0.1:9546"  # Chain B RPC endpoint

# Your wallet address (should be the same on both chains)
export ETH_FROM=your_wallet_address
```

4. Deploy the contracts on both chains:
```bash
# Deploy to Chain A
forge script script/SuperchainERC20Deployer.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_A --broadcast

# Deploy to Chain B
forge script script/SuperchainERC20Deployer.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_B --broadcast
```

5. Update the contract addresses in `evc/script/crossChainVaultOp.sh`:
```bash
# Edit these addresses to match your deployment
ASSET_ADDRESS="your_asset_address"
VAULT_ADDRESS="your_vault_address"
EVC_ADDRESS="your_evc_address"
```

## Interacting with the Cross-Chain Vault

### Using the Script

The `crossChainVaultOp.sh` script provides an interactive menu for interacting with the vault system.

1. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x evc/script/crossChainVaultOp.sh
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
./evc/script/crossChainVaultOp.sh
```

### Available Operations

1. **Approve tokens**
   - Approves the vault to spend your tokens
   - Required before depositing

2. **Deposit tokens**
   - Deposits tokens into the vault on the current chain
   - Requires prior approval

3. **Check balance**
   - Shows your current vault share balance
   - Converts shares to asset value

4. **Withdraw tokens**
   - Withdraws tokens from the vault
   - Can be used on either chain

5. **Cross-chain deposit to Chain B**
   - Initiates a cross-chain deposit from Chain A to Chain B
   - Requires:
     - Amount to deposit
     - Target chain ID (Chain B)
     - Target vault address on Chain B

### Example Usage

1. First, approve tokens:
```bash
# Select "Approve tokens" from the menu
# Enter amount (default is 1 token = 1000000000000000000 wei)
```

2. Perform a cross-chain deposit:
```bash
# Select "Cross-chain deposit to Chain B"
# Enter:
# - Amount to deposit
# - Chain B's chain ID
# - Vault address on Chain B
```

3. Check your balance on Chain B:
```bash
# Switch RPC endpoint to Chain B
export RPC_ENDPOINT=$RPC_B
# Run the script again and select "Check balance"
```

## Important Notes

1. **Cross-Chain Messaging**
   - Messages take time to be processed between chains
   - Monitor the transaction status on both chains
   - The messenger contract address is predeployed at `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000007`

2. **Gas Fees**
   - You need sufficient funds for:
     - Token approval transaction
     - Cross-chain message transaction
     - Gas fees on both chains

3. **Security**
   - Never share your private key
   - Keep your environment variables secure
   - Verify contract addresses before interactions

4. **Troubleshooting**
   - If a transaction fails, check:
     - Gas fees
     - Contract addresses
     - RPC endpoint connectivity
     - Chain synchronization status

## Architecture

The system consists of:
1. SuperchainERC20 token contract (deployed on both chains)
2. Vault contract (deployed on both chains)
3. Cross-chain messenger (predeployed on both chains)
4. EVC (Ethereum Vault Connector) contract

Messages flow from Chain A â†’ Messenger â†’ Chain B, with the messenger handling the cross-chain communication.

## Development

To modify or extend the system:

1. Update contract addresses in the scripts
2. Modify the vault contract for new functionality
3. Update the cross-chain messaging logic if needed
4. Test thoroughly on both chains
